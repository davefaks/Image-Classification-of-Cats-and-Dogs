# Image Classification of Cats and Dogs

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a robust neural network model for classifying images of cats and dogs. Leveraging transfer learning with a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model, the goal is to achieve high accuracy and strong generalization on unseen data.

Through careful preprocessing and model fine-tuning, this project builds an effective classifier suitable for real-world applications. Insights gained from this work can inform future image recognition projects and contribute to advancements in computer vision.
